# How to Install TrackNGo on Mobile (PWA) 📱✨

Since TrackNGo is a modern web app (PWA), you don't need Expo Go! You can install it directly from your browser.

## 1. Connect Mobile to WiFi

Ensure your phone is on the **SAME WiFi network** as your computer.

## 2. Open in Chrome (Android) or Safari (iOS)

1.  On your computer, find your **Local IP Address** (e.g., `10.70.87.24`).
2.  On your phone browser, go to:
    `http://10.70.87.24:5173`
    *(Replace `10.70.87.24` with your actual PC IP if different)*

## 3. Install as App

### Android (Chrome)
1.  Tap the **Three Dots (Menu)** in the top right.
2.  Tap **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install App"**.
3.  Tap **Install**.
4.  Go to your home screen -> You'll see the **TrackNGo** icon! 🚌
5.  Open it -> It launches full-screen like a real app!

### iOS (Safari)
1.  Tap the **Share Icon** (square with arrow up).
2.  Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
3.  Tap **Add**.
4.  Launch from your home screen.

## Why this is better than Expo Go?
-   **No App Store required.**
-   **Updates instantly** when you change code on PC.
-   **Full Screen Experience.**
-   **Uses Real GPS & Camera.**

## Troubleshooting

-   **"Site can't be reached"**: Check if your firewall is blocking port `5173` or `8080`.
-   **"Camera/GPS not working"**: Check browser permissions. Android usually asks for permission on first use.
-   **"Location incorrect"**: Ensure GPS is enabled on your phone.
